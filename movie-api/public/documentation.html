  <h1>MyFlix Movie App</h1>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>To build the server-side component of a movies web application. The web
           application will provide users with access to information about different
           movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
           personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
        </p>
